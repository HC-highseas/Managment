# Hostel Management System

## Description
This **Hostel Management System** is a simple console-based C++ application to manage hostel students' data. It allows the user to add student records, view all student details, search for specific students, and manage fines effectively. The data is persisted using a text file (`hostel_data.txt`) to ensure it remains accessible between program executions.
